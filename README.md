# python-challenge

## Background

This project involved transitioning from Excel sheets to Python programming, applying newly acquired scripting skills to complete two challenges: PyBank and PyPoll.

## Setup

1.  Created a new repository called `python-challenge`.
2.  Cloned the repository locally.
3.  Created folders for each assignment: `PyBank` and `PyPoll`.
4.  Added the following to each folder:
    -   `main.py` for the main script.
    -   `Resources` folder with the CSV files.
    -   `analysis` folder with the analysis results.
5.  Pushed changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## PyBank

Analyzed financial records in `budget_data.csv` to calculate:

-   Total number of months
-   Net total amount of "Profit/Losses"
-   Average change in "Profit/Losses"
-   Greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
-   Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount)
- The script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

Analyzed election data in `election_data.csv` to calculate:

-   Total number of votes
-   List of candidates who received votes
-   Percentage of votes each candidate won
-   Total number of votes each candidate won
-   Winner of the election based on popular vote
The script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.

## Skills Acquired

-   Python programming
-   Data analysis
-   CSV file handling
-   Git and GitHub/GitLab workflow
-   Script organization and debugging
